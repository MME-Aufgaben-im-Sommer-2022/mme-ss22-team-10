# Working with the project

## Development

### ⬇️ Getting code

- Before you start working, download the latest version of the project:
  - (make sure you're on the correct branch, try working **alone** on a branch)
  - `pull` all changes from the remote repository

### 📝 Making changes to the code

- To start the dev server run `npm run dev`
  - You can view the website by clicking the link in the terminal
  - Changes you make to the code will be automatically reflected in the browser

### 💾 Saving changes

When you are done working, `commit` your changes with
- **a meaningful message:** \<type of change>: \<short description>
   - e.g. `fixed: login button not working`
- (if you are in a good mood, add an emoji to the beginning of the message, chosen from [gitmoji](https://gitmoji.dev/))
   - e.g. `🐛  fixed: login button not working`

### ⬆️ Sharing code

To make the code available to others:

- push all changes to the remote repository via any of the following ways:
  - use the editors built-in Git functionality
  - using the GitHub desktop app
  - using the command line
- if you get an error message (conflict), contact the team ;)
