# Working with the project


## ⬇️ Getting code

- Before you start working, download the latest version of the project:
  - (make sure you're on the correct branch, work **alone!** on a branch to avoid conflicts)
  - `pull` all changes from the remote repository (via editor/GitHub desktop/command line)

## 📝 Making changes to the code

- To start the dev server run `npm run dev`
  - You can now view the website by clicking the link in the terminal
  - Changes you make to the code will be automatically reflected in the browser

## 💾 Saving changes

When you are done working, `commit` your changes with
- **a meaningful message:** \<type of change>: \<short description>
   - e.g. "fixed: login button not working"
- (if you are in a good mood, add an emoji to the beginning of the message, chosen from [gitmoji](https://gitmoji.dev/))
   - e.g. "🐛  fixed: login button not working"

## ⬆️ Sharing code

To make the code available to others:

- `push` all changes to your branch in the GitHub repository (via editor/GitHub desktop/command line)
  - if you get an error message (conflict), contact the team ;)

## 🔀 Combining code

To get changes from other teammembers into your branch:

- `merge` the changes from the other teammember's branch into your branch (via editor/GitHub desktop/command line)
  - if you get an error message (conflict), contact the team ;)
