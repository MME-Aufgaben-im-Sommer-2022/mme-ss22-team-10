## How should I name my classes or ids?

### Class names

To add a class to an HTML element, add it as a `class` attribute:

```html
<div class="my-class"></div>
```

To add multiple classes to an HTML element, add them as a `class` attribute separated by whitespaces:

```html
<div class="my-class my-other-class"></div>
```

### ID names

Adding ids to an HTML element works the same way, but instead of adding them as a `class` attribute, you add them as an `id` attribute:

```html
<div id="my-id my-other-id"></div>
```
